    <p>I am currently learning web development using 
        <a href="https://theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> and
        <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">Free Code Camp</a>.</p>
    <div>
        <p>The area below here will be used to practice the creation of lists. Hello happy little lists!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I am learning web development as a challenging mental exercise. So far it isn't easy, but I feel like I am overcoming my first roadblock by making this website.</li>
            <li>The secret seems to be that I need to not only take notes as I am learning stuff, but to practice it on my own. Like what I am doing right now!</li>
            <li>I am trying to remember that there will be future roadblocks but I also need to remember how great overcoming this roadblock feels. I feel like I might be able to do this! Hopefully in a year I will be a Web Developer!</li>
            <li>I got distracted in the creation of this page when I noticed that I don't know what the difference between an element and a tag is. From Stack Overflow: a tag is an opening or closing entity, a element encompasses the opening tag, the content, and the closing tag. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now for an ordered list!</p>
        <p>Why I want to learn web development:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>I love learning and this is very difficult. I feel incredibly accomplished when something 'clicks'.</li>
            <li>Web development, as far as I can tell, is a growing field that I can build a career in.</li>
            <li>This allows me to let my creative side out, especially with CSS. (Which I haven't added to this page yet. I will soon though).</li>
            <li>By creating a habit of learning and generally 'doing stuff' I find that I am able to accomplish more things.</li>
        </ol>

            Remove the text in the ( ) above once CSS elements have been added to the page.

        The purpose of this page is to have a place to practice creating a website and to see how
        things progress by commiting it to github whenever major changes take place. Not only will this 
        be an example to look back on, but it should also serve as encouragement as I continue to learn.
